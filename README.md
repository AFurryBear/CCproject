# CCproject
Here is some simple codes to count probability maps of CC topography.
Part1 is from cortex to CC, while part2 is from CC to cortex.
For Part1, we only include fibres through homo-regions, in 2 templates on surface, BN_Atlas and HCPMMP.
For Part2, we provide several versions for different needs.
  1. vertice-wised map(including all fibres generated)
  2. label-wised map(including all fibres generated, labels from HCPMMP/BN_Atlas are set to be the smallest unit)
  3. homolabel-wised map(including only fibres through homo-regions)
